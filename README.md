# polymedia (.rs)

Some random rust program to hopefully receive updates from D-Bus on currently playing media. Using
the MPRIS protocol as pretty much everything (browser, spotify) implements that. It doesn't work
yet lol and I have no idea what I'm doing.

Eventually this program should update a Polybar module (hence the name) to display song info, and
provide controls to pause or go to next/previous song.

# Usage

probably shouldn't
